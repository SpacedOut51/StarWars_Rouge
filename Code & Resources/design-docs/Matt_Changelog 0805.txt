Tusken HP increased to 200
	- class Tusken;
		super (..., 200, ...)

Tusken Attack doubled by giving new weapon, Gaffi Stick
	Created TuskenGaffiStick class, extends entity
	has weapon capability
	does 20 damage, double what the Tuskens would do barehanded
	All tuskens now hold a gaffiStick object
	given symbol 'G'

Added Tuskens to Map
	Three additional tuskens have been hardcoded in at different locations
	Added with names in SWWorld, Tim, Tom, Tina and Tony
	otherwise identical
	# are the attacks they do to each other working? they shouldnt do anything #

Lightsaber damage reduced
	Damage reduced from 1000000 to 100

Aunt Beru and Uncle Owen
	SWLegends with no possible force
	## is this a flaw in our design? ## 

--- ASSIGNMENT 1 DESIGNS ---

Lightsaber user needs force
	modified from Lightsaber entity getForceLvL original plan, as listsaber entity has no vision of who is holding it
	changed attack action to check for force levels and legend status

	uses getSymbol() method from SWEntityInterface to detect lightsaber being held
	## still needs to be able to see getForce() method - unsure of implementation ##
	## can forcelvlv be given to actor? there are legends with no possibility of force,
	   and given the limited methods of force levels changing, there isn't a high chance of mistake ## 

SWLegend needs force value
	added int variable, setForce(), and getForce() methods
	## currently not used ##



=== NOTES ===

class Player breaks game when it's legendAct() replaces act(). 
getUserDirection takes actor, not legend. how to allow it to accept both?
